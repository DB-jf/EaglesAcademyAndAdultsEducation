/**
 * Implementation of A* (A-Star) algorithm for pathfinding with heuristic optimization.
 * 
 * <p>A* is an informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to find the optimal path
 * between two nodes in a weighted graph. It maintains two cost functions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>g(n) - actual cost from start node to node n</li>
 *   <li>h(n) - heuristic estimate from node n to goal node</li>
 *   <li>f(n) = g(n) + h(n) - estimated total cost of path through n</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The algorithm is optimal when the heuristic function is admissible (never overestimates
 * the actual cost) and consistent. This implementation uses the Haversine distance formula
 * as the heuristic, which satisfies both conditions for geographic pathfinding.
 * 
 * <p>Time Complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth
 * <p>Space Complexity: O(b^d) for storing nodes in open and closed sets
 *
